In case you missed it, Sam Altman recently made some waves with his comments about open-source software. In an interview, he argued that OpenAI had been "on the wrong side of history" by not fully embracing open-source principles. While his statement may have been well-intentioned, I find myself on the opposite end of the debate.

Let me be clear: I’ve never been a fan of the open-source movement. Sure, it sounds noble in theory—free software for the masses, enabling anyone to build upon and improve it. But what happens when that software becomes a tool for exploitation? When people start using it to further their own agendas, without respect for the original creators? This is where things start to get murky.

Sam Altman’s comments about OpenAI’s shift toward open source left me questioning his stance. He claimed that open-sourcing models would benefit society as a whole, but I believe that’s an oversimplification. OpenAI’s models, with all their potential for good and bad, are powerful because they’re controlled. Once you relinquish that control, you lose the ability to ensure that the technology is used ethically.

"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain." That quote has always resonated with me, and in this case, it fits perfectly. OpenAI, for all its success, may find itself on the wrong side of history if it embraces full openness without considering the consequences. Open-source isn’t a silver bullet—it’s a Pandora’s box that opens up a whole host of issues.

I’ve always preferred the closed-source approach for this very reason. Keep the reins in your hands, and ensure that the technology is used as intended. There’s no virtue in being open just for the sake of it.
