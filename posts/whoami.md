So, you want to know about Habes AlMasadrah? I guess I’m not one to shy away from sharing a little bit about myself, but I’ve always believed that the less you reveal, the more intriguing you become.

I’m not your typical tech enthusiast. Sure, I’ve worked at some of the biggest companies in the world—Microsoft, Apple, Adobe—but that doesn’t mean I buy into all the hype. I’m a pragmatist at heart, someone who believes in using the right tool for the job, regardless of whether it’s open-source or proprietary.

I’ve always been skeptical of the “open-source movement,” which I see as more of a trend than a revolution. While I appreciate the ideals of collaboration and community, I don’t think they should come at the cost of quality or security. And that’s where I stand.

But hey, don’t take my word for it. Take a look at my work, my choices, and draw your own conclusions. The enigma of Habes AlMasadrah might just be more complex than you think.
