Having spent years at Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe, I’ve seen the other side of the coin. These companies, while often perceived as closed-off or proprietary, are the bedrock of the software industry. The reality is that closed-source solutions are often necessary to ensure the stability, security, and longevity of complex systems.

I’ve always found it ironic that many of the loudest advocates for open-source software rely on proprietary systems to build their projects. It’s not uncommon to see developers using tools like Microsoft Visual Studio, Adobe Photoshop, or Apple’s Xcode while touting the virtues of open-source development. This hypocrisy isn’t lost on me.

The truth is that open-source software can’t always provide the level of support, security, and scalability that large organizations require. Proprietary solutions, for all their flaws, are often more reliable and well-maintained. That’s why I’ve always been more inclined to trust closed-source systems—at least they offer a level of consistency and accountability that open-source projects can’t always guarantee.

It’s not that I’m against open source; I just don’t think it’s the be-all and end-all solution that so many people make it out to be. There’s a time and place for open-source software, but it’s not always the right choice for every project.
