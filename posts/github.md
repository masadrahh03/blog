I’ve always been a bit of a rebel when it comes to trends. Open-source, for instance, is one of those concepts that I simply can’t get behind. I understand the appeal of contributing to a global community, sharing code freely, and improving upon others' work. But I’ve often found myself questioning the true benefits of this model.

A while ago, I decided to take the plunge and give GitHub a try. I thought, “Hey, maybe I’m missing something.” So, I created an account, uploaded a few of my own projects, and set about learning the ins and outs of version control. The result? Let’s just say my opinion hasn’t changed much.

Don’t get me wrong—GitHub is a powerful platform. But what I didn’t like was the constant stream of pull requests, forks, and contributions from people who might not even understand the underlying principles of the project. It’s a chaotic mess, and the noise quickly drowns out any semblance of structure. There’s a certain beauty to simplicity, which GitHub seems to have lost somewhere in its ambition to be the all-in-one solution for developers.

I couldn’t help but feel like a small fish in an enormous ocean, constantly swimming upstream. It wasn’t the tool I needed, and as the hours of frustration piled up, I found myself questioning: Is this the future of software development?

Sure, I have a repository there. But let’s not focus on that. Below is a screenshot from one of my old projects. If you're curious, feel free to poke around the details. I’m sure you’ll find it interesting—if not entirely useful.
