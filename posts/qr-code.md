QR codes—those seemingly simple squares of black and white—have fascinated me lately. At first glance, they’re nothing more than a way to quickly store and share information. But delve deeper, and you’ll uncover something far more interesting: the resilience of the QR code.

QR codes use error correction techniques that allow them to remain functional even if part of the code is corrupted. This got me thinking: How much can you corrupt a QR code before it becomes unreadable? And, more intriguingly, how can you fix a damaged QR code and restore it to its original state?

My curiosity led me to experiment with QR code corruption and restoration. I intentionally introduced errors, scrambling parts of the code and testing the limits of its error correction capabilities. It was like playing with a puzzle where the pieces are designed to fall into place no matter how much you distort them.

Of course, I couldn’t do this alone. So, I turned to the modern-day oracle—ChatGPT. In a moment of inspiration (or desperation), I asked it about the art of intentionally corrupting and fixing QR codes. The conversation that followed was surprisingly insightful. ChatGPT explained how QR codes use a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm to fix up to 30% of a code’s data, making it resistant to damage.

For me, this experiment wasn’t just about QR codes; it was a lesson in understanding data integrity and the resilience of digital information. It's a concept that I think is crucial in today’s world, where data is everything.
